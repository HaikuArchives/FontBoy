SplitPane1.0
by YNOP

Split pane are those things you see in Mail/News reads, File Managers, Imageviewers, and lots of other places where you want split views. Most of the time the user can move the little bar back and forth so that is in the right place.  Well thats what this class is. Its that little bar with all the bells and whistls.  I cant think of any more options that anyone would want for a splitpane view. So Here it is.

                    RUN THE DEMO - ITS REALY KEWL

BeIDE Documentation:
	The BeIDE docs are realy kewl.  Look up the def for a SplitPane or any of its methods then you will get this spiffy little doc.  It has all the good stuff in it. All the function and what they do. Also it looks just like a Be doc so you should like it... the Docs folder can be anywhere on you system. BeIDE will search for it and load it upinto Net+ for you.  I also included the HTML in this dir also so that you can view it yourself if you want.
