Introduction
Fontboy is a small application to show your installed fonts in BeOS. You can get additional information of the selected font and a preview of the complete Unicode charset. Fontboy allows you to adjust the appearence to your desired needs and it's fast because BeOS is.

Features
- Watch all your installed True Type and Type 1 fonts
- Browse the complete Unicode charset of a font
- Magnified view of single charcters
- Drag & drop support
- Tooltips
- Highly customizeable

Installation
Copy the unzipped folder to any location you want.

How to use Fontboy
In the main window all installed fonts will be displayed by a sampletext and their name and style. Use single click to select a font. Use double click to get detail information about a font. A right mouseclick will show a popup menu where you can also open the detail window or refresh the fontlist after installing new fonts.

The detail window shows you further information about the selected font and graphical view of its Unicode character set. The selected character in the matrix will be shown in a bigger view on the left side. Use mouse or cursorkeys to change the selection. Use upper right navigation buttons or PageUp/PageDown keys to change page. Try Drag & Drop of characters!

Preferences
To change the application settings open the preferences from the menu Edit.
General let you toggle the splashscreen when starting Fontboy and turn off the ToolTips.
List let you adjust the appearance of the fontlist in the main window. 
Details let you adjust the appearance of the detail window. 
When Live update! is selected ALL settings will be applied immediately.

Tips
- Fonts once loaded and displayed are bufferd by the BeOS system. When you have some hundred or more fonts installed buffers may run out which will result in a loss of performance. To avoid this you should increase the size of the font cache in the BeOS Font Preferences. 
- The Detail windows displays the complete Unicode character set. Try the Haru font from the BeOS 4.5 CD to see a nice Unicode font including some thousand characters.
- Drag & Drop of a font in main window also sends a FFont object but there are not a lot of applications that support it.
